### Guidelines
* Code should be C89 compatible and compilable as C++.
* Each .c file should represent a module. (see architecture.md for more details)
* Public functions and variables should be prefixed by module to avoid name collisions. (e.g. `Game_Reset`)
* Private functions should be named using pascal case. Prefixing module is optional - do it when it makes sense.
* Private variables don't really have a consistent style.

### Types
* Explicit integer size typedefs are provided in `Core.h` for when needed. Otherwise just use int.
* A few common simple structs are typedef-ed, but are rarely otherwise.
* `cc_bool` is an alias for 8 bit unsigned integer
* `PackedCol` field order differs depending on the underlying 3D graphics API

Note: The explicit integer size typedefs may not have been defined if you aren't compiling using GCC/Clang/MSVC, so for other compilers you may need to add them into `Core.h`

### Strings

A custom string type (`cc_string`) is used rather than `char*` strings in most places (see [strings](strings.md) page for more details)

*Note: Several functions will take raw `char*` for performance, but this is not encouraged*

#### String arguments
String arguments are annotated to indicate storage and readonly requirements. These are:
- `const cc_string*` - String is not modified at all
- `cc_string*` - Characters in string may be modified
- `STRING_REF` - Macro annotation indicating a **reference is kept to the characters**

To make it extra clear, functions with `STRING_REF` arguments usually also have `_UNSAFE_` as part of their name.

For example, consider the function `cc_string Substring_UNSAFE(STRING_REF const cc_string* str, length)`

The *input string* is not modified at all. However, the characters of the *returned string* points to the characters of the *input string*, so modifying the characters in the *input string* also modifies the *returned string*.

In general, use of `const cc_string*` is preferred when possible, and `STRING_REF` as little as possible.
