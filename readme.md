# We need your help

ClassiCube strives to replicate the original Minecraft Classic experience by **strictly adhering to [clean room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) reverse engineering approach**.

If you're interested in documenting or verifying the behaviour of the original Minecraft Classic, please get in contact on the [ClassiCube Discord](https://classicube.net/discord)


# How to play
Initially, you will need to run ClassiCube.exe to download the required assets from minecraft.net and classicube.net.<br>
Just click 'OK' to the dialog menu that appears when you start the launcher.

> **Note:** When running from within VirtualBox, disable Mouse Integration, otherwise the in-game camera won't work properly.

**Singleplayer mode**
Run ClassiCube.exe, then click Singleplayer at the main menu.

**Multiplayer mode**
Run ClassiCube.exe. You can connect to LAN/locally hosted servers, and classicube.net servers if you have a [ClassiCube account](https://www.classicube.net/).

#### *Stuck on OpenGL 1.1?*
The most common reason for being stuck on OpenGL 1.1 is non-working GPU drivers - so if possible, you should try either installing or updating the drivers for your GPU.

Otherwise:
* On Windows, you can still run the OpenGL build of ClassiCube anyways. <br> 
(You can try downloading and using the MESA software renderer from [here](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/llvmpipe/windows/) for slightly better performance though)
* On other operating systems, you will have to [compile the game yourself](#Compiling). <br> 
Don't forget to add `-DCC_BUILD_GL11` to the compilation command line so that the compiled game supports OpenGL 1.1.

# Supported systems

ClassiCube runs on:
* Windows - 95 and later
* macOS - 10.5 or later (can be compiled for 10.3/10.4 though)

# Compiling 

*Note: The instructions below automatically compile ClassiCube with the recommended defaults for the platform. <br>
If you (not recommended) want to override the defaults (e.g. to compile OpenGL build on Windows), see [here](doc/overriding-defaults.md) for details.*

## Compiling - Windows

##### Using Visual Studio
1. Open ClassiCube.sln *(File -> Open -> Project/Solution)*
2. Compile/Build it *(Build -> Build Solution)*.

If you get a `The Windows SDK version 5.1 was not found` compilation error, [see here for how to fix](doc/compile-fixes.md#visual-studio-unsupported-platform-toolset)

##### Using Visual Studio (command line)
1. Use 'Developer Tools for Visual Studio' from Start Menu
2. Navigate to the directory with ClassiCube's source code
3. Run `cl.exe src\*.c third_party\bearssl\*.c /link user32.lib gdi32.lib winmm.lib dbghelp.lib shell32.lib comdlg32.lib /out:ClassiCube.exe`

##### Using MinGW-w64
Assuming that you used the installer from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ :
1. Install MinGW-W64
2. Use either *Run Terminal* from Start Menu or run *mingw-w64.bat* in the installation folder
3. Navigate to the directory with ClassiCube's source code
4. Run either:
    * `make mingw` - produces a simple non-optimised executable, easier to debug
    * `make mingw RELEASE=1` - produces an optimised executable, harder to debug

##### Using MinGW
Assuming that you used the installer from https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/ :
1. Install MinGW. You need mingw32-base-bin and msys-base-bin packages.
2. Run *msys.bat* in the *C:\MinGW\msys\1.0* folder.
3. Navigate to the directory with ClassiCube's source code
4. Run either:
    * `make mingw` - produces a simple non-optimised executable, easier to debug
    * `make mingw RELEASE=1` - produces an optimised executable, harder to debug

##### Using TCC (Tiny C Compiler)
Setting up TCC:
1. Download and extract `tcc-0.9.27-win64-bin.zip` from https://bellard.org/tcc/
2. Download `winapi-full-for-0.9.27.zip` from https://bellard.org/tcc/ 
3. Copy `winapi` folder and `_mingw_dxhelper.h` from `winapi-full-for-0.9.27.zip` into TCC's `include` folder

Compiling with TCC:
1. Navigate to the directory with ClassiCube's source code
2. Run `tcc.exe -o ClassiCube.exe src/*.c third_party/bearssl/*.c -lwinmm -lgdi32 -luser32 -lcomdlg32 -lshell32`<br>
(Note: You may need to specify the full path to `tcc.exe` instead of just `tcc.exe`)

## Compiling - Linux

##### Using gcc/clang
1. Install X11, XInput2, and OpenGL development libraries if necessary. <br>
For Ubuntu, these are the `libx11-dev`, `libxi-dev` and `libgl1-mesa-dev` packages
2. Run either:
    * `make linux` - produces a simple non-optimised executable, easier to debug
    * `make linux RELEASE=1` - produces an optimised executable, harder to debug

##### Cross compiling for Windows (32 bit):
1. Install MinGW-w64 if necessary. (Ubuntu: `gcc-mingw-w64` package)
2. Run ```make mingw CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc```

##### Cross compiling for Windows (64 bit):
1. Install MinGW-w64 if necessary. (Ubuntu: `gcc-mingw-w64` package)
2. Run ```make mingw CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc```

##### Raspberry Pi
Although the regular linux compiliation flags will work fine, to take full advantage of the hardware:

```make rpi```

## Compiling - macOS
1. Install a C compiler if necessary. The easiest way of obtaining one is by installing **Xcode**.
2. Run either:
    * `make darwin` - produces a simple non-optimised executable, easier to debug
    * `make darwin RELEASE=1` - produces an optimised executable, harder to debug

##### Using Xcode GUI

1. Open the `misc/macOS/CCMAC.xcodeproj` project in Xcode
2. Compile the project

## Compiling - for Android

NOTE: If you are distributing a modified version, **please change the package ID from `com.classicube.android.client` to something else** - otherwise Android users won't be able to have both ClassiCube and your modified version installed at the same time on their Android device

##### Using Android Studio GUI

Open `android` folder in Android Studio (TODO explain more detailed)

##### Using command line (gradle)

Run `gradlew` in android folder (TODO explain more detailed)

## Compiling - for iOS

iOS version will have issues as it's incomplete and only tested in iOS Simulator

NOTE: If you are distributing a modified version, **please change the bundle ID from `com.classicube.ios.client` to something else** - otherwise iOS users won't be able to have both ClassiCube and your modified version installed at the same time on their iOS device

##### Using Xcode GUI

1. Open the `misc/ios/CCIOS.xcodeproj` project in Xcode
2. Compile the project

##### Using command line (Xcode)

`xcodebuild -sdk iphoneos -configuration Debug` (TODO explain more detailed)

## Compiling - webclient

1. Install emscripten if necessary.
2. Run either:
    * `make web` - produces simple non-optimised output, easier to debug
    * `make web RELEASE=1` - produces optimised output, harder to debug

The generated javascript file has some issues. [See here for how to fix](doc/compile-fixes.md#webclient-patches)

For details on how to integrate the webclient into a website, see [here](doc/hosting-webclient.md)

</details>

## Documentation

Functions and variables in .h files are mostly documented.

Further information (e.g. style) for ClassiCube's source code can be found in the doc and misc folders.

#### Known compilation errors

[Fixes for compilation errors when using musl or old glibc for C standard library](doc/compile-fixes.md#common-compilation-errors)

#### Tips
* Press escape (after joining a world) or pause to switch to the pause menu.
* Pause menu -> Options -> Controls lists all of the key combinations used by the client. 
* Note that toggling 'vsync' to on will minimise CPU usage, while off will maximise chunk loading speed.
* Press F to cycle view distance. Lower view distances can improve performance.

* If the server has disabled hacks, key combinations such as fly and speed will not do anything.
* To see the list of built in commands, type `/client`.
* To see help for a given built in command, type `/client help <command name>`.
