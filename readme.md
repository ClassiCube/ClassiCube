# We need your help

ClassiCube strives to replicate the original Minecraft Classic experience by **strictly following a [clean room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) reverse engineering approach**.

If you're interested in documenting or verifying the behaviour of the original Minecraft Classic, please get in contact with me. (`unknownshadow200` on Discord)


# How to play
Initially, you will need to run ClassiCube.exe to download the required assets from minecraft.net and classicube.net.<br>
Just click 'OK' to the dialog menu that appears when you start the launcher.

**Singleplayer**
Run ClassiCube.exe, then click Singleplayer at the main menu.

**Multiplayer**
Run ClassiCube.exe. You can connect to LAN/locally hosted servers, and classicube.net servers if you have a [ClassiCube account](https://www.classicube.net/).

**Note:** When running from within VirtualBox, disable Mouse Integration, otherwise the camera will not work properly

#### *Stuck on OpenGL 1.1?*
The most common reason for being stuck on OpenGL 1.1 is non-working GPU drivers - so if possible, you should try either installing or updating the drivers for your GPU.

Otherwise:
* On Windows, you can still run the OpenGL build of ClassiCube anyways. (You can try downloading and using the MESA software renderer from [here](http://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/llvmpipe/windows/) for slightly better performance though)
* On other operating systems, you will have to [compile the game yourself](#Compiling). Don't forget to add `-DCC_BUILD_GL11` to the compilation command line so that the compiled game supports OpenGL 1.1.

# Supported systems

ClassiCube runs on:
* Windows - 95 and later
* macOS - 10.5 or later (but can be compiled to work with 10.3/10.4 though)

# Compiling 

*Note: The various instructions below automatically compile ClassiCube with the recommended defaults for the platform. <br>
If you (not recommended) want to override the defaults (e.g. to compile OpenGL build on Windows), see [here](doc/overriding-defaults.md) for details.*

## Compiling - Windows

##### Using Visual Studio
Open ClassiCube.sln *(File -> Open -> Project/Solution)* and compile it *(Build -> Build Solution)*.

If you get a `The Windows SDK version 5.1 was not found` compilation error, [see here for how to fix](doc/compile-fixes.md#visual-studio-unsupported-platform-toolset)

##### Using Visual Studio (command line)
1. Use 'Developer Tools for Visual Studio' from Start Menu
2. Navigate to the directory with ClassiCube's source code
3. Enter `cl.exe *.c /link user32.lib gdi32.lib winmm.lib dbghelp.lib shell32.lib comdlg32.lib /out:ClassiCube.exe`

##### Using MinGW-w64
I am assuming you used the installer from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/
1. Install MinGW-W64
2. Use either *Run Terminal* from Start Menu or run *mingw-w64.bat* in the installation folder
3. Navigate to the directory with ClassiCube's source code
4. Enter `gcc -fno-math-errno *.c -o ClassiCube.exe -mwindows -lwinmm`

##### Using MinGW
I am assuming you used the installer from https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/
1. Install MinGW. You need mingw32-base-bin and msys-base-bin packages.
2. Run *msys.bat* in the *C:\MinGW\msys\1.0* folder.
2. Navigate to the directory with ClassiCube's source code
4. Enter `gcc -fno-math-errno *.c -o ClassiCube.exe -mwindows -lwinmm`

##### Using TCC (Tiny C Compiler)
Setting up TCC:
1. Download and extract `tcc-0.9.27-win64-bin.zip` from https://bellard.org/tcc/
2. In TCC's `lib/kernel32.def`, add missing `RtlCaptureContext` at line 554 (In between `RtlAddFunctionTable` and `RtlDeleteFunctionTable`)
3. Download `winapi-full-for-0.9.27.zip` from https://bellard.org/tcc/ 
4. Copy `winapi` folder and `_mingw_dxhelper.h` from `winapi-full-for-0.9.27.zip` into TCC's `include` folder

Compiling with TCC:
1. Navigate to the directory with ClassiCube's source code
2. In `ExtMath.c`, change `fabsf` to `fabs` and `sqrtf` to `sqrt`
3. Enter `tcc.exe -o ClassiCube.exe *.c -lwinmm -lgdi32 -luser32 -lcomdlg32 -lshell32`<br>
(Note: You may need to specify the full path to `tcc.exe` instead of just `tcc.exe`)

## Compiling - Linux

##### Using gcc/clang

Install appropriate libs as required. For ubuntu these are: libx11-dev, libxi-dev and libgl1-mesa-dev

```gcc -fno-math-errno src/*.c -o ClassiCube -rdynamic -lpthread -lX11 -lXi -lGL -ldl```

##### Cross compiling for Windows (32 bit):

```i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -fno-math-errno src/*.c -o ClassiCube.exe -mwindows -lwinmm```

##### Cross compiling for Windows (64 bit):

```x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -fno-math-errno src/*.c -o ClassiCube.exe -mwindows -lwinmm```

##### Raspberry Pi
Although the regular linux compiliation flags will work fine, to take full advantage of the hardware:

```gcc -fno-math-errno src/*.c -o ClassiCube -DCC_BUILD_RPI -rdynamic -lpthread -lX11 -lXi -lEGL -lGLESv2 -ldl```

## Compiling - macOS

```cc -fno-math-errno src/*.c src/*.m -o ClassiCube -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL -framework IOKit -lobjc```

Note: You may need to install Xcode before you can compile ClassiCube

##### Using Xcode GUI

Open the `misc/macOS/CCMAC.xcodeproj` project in Xcode, and then compile it

## Compiling - for Android

NOTE: If you are distributing a modified version, **please change the package ID from `com.classicube.android.client` to something else** - otherwise Android users won't be able to have both ClassiCube and your modified version installed at the same time on their Android device

##### Using Android Studio GUI

Open `android` folder in Android Studio (TODO explain more detailed)

##### Using command line (gradle)

Run `gradlew` in android folder (TODO explain more detailed)

## Compiling - for iOS

iOS version will have issues as it's incomplete and only tested in iOS Simulator

NOTE: If you are distributing a modified version, **please change the bundle ID from `com.classicube.ios.client` to something else** - otherwise iOS users won't be able to have both ClassiCube and your modified version installed at the same time on their iOS device

##### Using Xcode GUI

Open the `ios/CCIOS.xcodeproj` project in Xcode, and then compile it

##### Using command line (Xcode)

`xcodebuild -sdk iphoneos -configuration Debug` (TODO explain more detailed)

## Compiling - webclient

```emcc src/*.c -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -s TOTAL_STACK=1Mb --js-library interop_web.js```

The generated javascript file has some issues. [See here for how to fix](doc/compile-fixes.md#webclient-patches)

#### Known compilation errors

[Fixes for compilation errors when using musl or old glibc for C standard library](doc/compile-fixes.md#common-compilation-errors)

#### Tips
* Press escape (after joining a world) or pause to switch to the pause menu.
* Pause menu -> Options -> Controls lists all of the key combinations used by the client. 
* Note that toggling 'vsync' to on will minimise CPU usage, while off will maximimise chunk loading speed.
* Press F to cycle view distance. A smaller number of visible chunks can improve performance.

* If the server has disabled hacks, key combinations such as fly and speed will not do anything.
* To see the list of built in commands, type `/client`.
* To see help for a given built in command, type `/client help <command name>`.
