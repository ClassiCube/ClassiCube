Ray-triangle intersection algorithm comes from:
"Fast, Minimum Storage Ray/Triangle Intersection, Möller & Trumbore. Journal of Graphics Tools, 1997."
C source at http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/cs/Personal/Tomas_Akenine-Moller/raytri/raytri.c, according to Möller's code page,
(http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/cs/Personal/Tomas_Akenine-Moller/code/), the code is public domain.


Ray-box intersection algorithm comes from:
"An efficient and robust ray-box intersection algorithm", Williams, Barrus, Morley & Shirley, Journal of Graphics Tools, 2005"
C++ source at http://www.cs.utah.edu/~awilliam/box/ does not appear to have an attached license.


Cell traversal of rays based on code I found that was in turn from http://www.xnawiki.com/index.php/Voxel_traversal
The archived about page (http://web.archive.org/web/20090412065116/http://www.xnawiki.com/index.php/XNAWiki:About) states
that "All code found on the wiki is considered public domain".


Frustum culling was based on the code from http://www.crownandcutlass.com/features/technicaldetails/frustum.html,
which is in turn archived from (now defunct) http://www.markmorley.com/
